> * Project Title: Advanced forest fire model and its self-organized criticality

## General Introduction

Diffusion is a ubiquitous phenomenon which refers to the process in which a substance or property spreads from one region to another, e.g, transfer of heat, virus spreading etc..

In this project, we will investigate the spreading of forest fire. In 1992, a famous forest fire model was introduced based on the Cellular Automata by Drossel and Schwabl. In 1995, Albano introduced a more generalized forest fire model considering the immunity from fire and the finite-size forest. Thus, during the past decades, researchers have shown a strong interest in the self-organized criticality, which is introduced by Bak et al. to describe the system evolves into a steady critical state irrespective of its initial conditions. Many actual systems including the spreading of forest fire are claimed to have the self-organized criticality behavior or power-law relationships. Power-law distributions of natural or man-made hazards provide important information on risk assessment and hazard protection.


## The Model

We will use our advanced forest fire model to study how the fire spread (measure the burned area) with time, finite size of forest, ignition probability, etc.. Compared to Drossel and Schwabl's model, we will consider more factors including the immunity from fire, the finite-size forest, density of forest, etc. to make simulation results fit better with actual forest fire data. Our model of course does not capture all the relevant aspects of the problem. To make it better, wind and ground elevation also need to be considered.


## Fundamental Questions

How is the relationship between the burned area and time?

How is the relationship between the burned area and the ignition probability?

How is the relationship between the burned area and the density of forest?

How is the relationship between the burned area and the size of forest and time?


## Expected Results

The size distribution of forest fire satisfied a good power law.
